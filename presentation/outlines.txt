Presentation



Preliminaries
* the payoff each player gets by playing certain strategies is contained in a matrix, we call this the
payoff matrix + example of matrix

Model
* explain the 2 player escape situation (without group chasing)
* the three strategies
* depends on probability of finishing first (formula)
* depends on drafting behind the leader
* explain recursion intuitively 
* explain coop coop case in depth with formulas and payoff

Motivation
* strategies in races can be crucial
* modelling races can lead to improved performance
* this is novel...

Slide
The solution
* Step 1: simulation
* Step 2: game theoretical model

Slide
Step 1: Simulation
* mathematical model (link to all papers)
* ????
* ???

Slide
Mathematical model

Next slides on simulation

Slide
Step 2: Game theory






Slide
Achievements
* Implemented the proposed simulation in papers
* (found out that one paper is fucked) Combined psychological model with performance model
* Game theoretical model which could be valuable for simulating races???
******outline contribution


Slide
Recap: 
* we've seen there is a problem
* we solved in ... way 
* we achieved see previous slide
* .. future work (what)
