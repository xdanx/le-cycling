slide Title (Dan):

Hello my name is Dan, and this is how a cycling race looks like :

Headbutting video ? (other vid ?)

I'm will present our group project called : [read title]



slide Motivation (Dan):



slide Our solution (Dan):

The solution we proposed is in two parts :

First a software model of general road cycling races, that tries to simulate the real-life conditions, based on a model we developed following the previous work from various sources.

Secondly, we have created a Game Theoritical framework, used to decide on optimal stategies in a given situation. For example what happens when a cyclist breaks away alone, or how much he would gain by cooperative with an adversary.

Alex and Robert are going to explain this Game Theory framework more indepth, but first Julian and César are going to introduce our Software Simulation.



slide The Simulation (Julian):



slide Physiological Model (César): 

So for the physical model, we took into account the two modes in which the muscles can function :

When you exercise your muscle produce lactic acid.

If the exercise your doing is not very intense, the aerobic metabolism is activated, which means that your organism has enough oxygen to eliminate the acid and that you can exercise for long period of time.
If the exercise is more intensive, the muscle enter in anaerobic mode and your organism can't get rid of the acid fast enough, so you will get tired and your muscle will start to burn when the acid accumulates.


We represent this functions by two different values in the simulation :

Pmax which is the maximum power output you can produce with your anaerobic metabolism.
And Pcp which is the maxium aerobic limit, so the maximum power you can produce without ever getting tired.

Your speed will be computed in different situations based on these values.
