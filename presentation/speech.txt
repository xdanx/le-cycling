Hello my name is Dan, and this is how a cycling race looks like :

Headbutting video ? (other vid ?)

I'm will present our group project called : [read title]



slide Motivation (Dan):



slide Our solution (Dan):

The solution we proposed is in two parts :

First a software model of general road cycling races, that tries to simulate the real-life conditions, based on a model we developed following the previous work from various sources.

Secondly, we have created a Game Theoritical framework, used to decide on optimal stategies in a given situation. For example what happens when a cyclist breaks away alone, or how much he would gain by cooperative with an adversary.

Alex and Robert are going to explain this Game Theory framework more indepth, but first Julian and CÃ©sar are going to introduce our Software Simulation.
